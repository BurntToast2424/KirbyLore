                <h2>The Ancients</h2>
                <p>The Ancients were the inhabitants of the world the series takes place in long before the series starts. 
                    They're were two factions, the Magical Ancients, and the Scientific Ancients, and artifacts of both can be seen throughout the series.
                    The Magical artifacts include the Master Crown from Return to Dream land, and the Star Rod from Kirby's Adventure.
                    The Scientific Artifacts include the Lor Starcutter, also from Return to Dream land, and the Clockwork Stars that show up in Superstar and Planet Robobot.<br><br>
                    While the origins of the Magical Ancients aren't entirely known, the Scientific Ancients are from the world Forgotten Land is set in, them having invented warp technology from analyzing Fecto Elfilis, and using it to leave the dimension behind.
                    The only known living Ancients include Galacta Knight, which, while they only show up in subgames not canon to the main timeline, does exist, sealed in a crystal for an unknown, large amount of time after the other Ancients feared their potential power.
                    The other is Hyness, having been banished for using powerful magic to save their civilization, such power being deemed a threat. Later, Hyness ends up worshipping and Releasing <a href="void.html">Void Termina.</a></p>
