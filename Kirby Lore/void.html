                <h2>Dark Matter</h2>
                <p>Dark Matter is formed from high amounts of energy, usually negative, and fought by Kibry many times throughout the series.
                    It does take many forms, such as the common Dark Matter, including the one seen in Dream Land 2, the only one seen taking a different form, as well as 
                    Zero, a greater form that can summon the lesser forms at will, 0², which is likely a revived form of Zero, 
                    Dark Mind, the mirror dimension version of Zero, Dark Nebula, a star shaped form, and Void, worshipped by Hyness, and referred to as a god by them,
                    and while void is not dark matter itself, it is the source of Dark Matter. Void was corrupted, and eventually resurrected as Void Termina.<br><br>
                    The Master Crown is also related to Dark Matter, as it forces Magolor to take a form similar to one, and Void summons a projection of the crown itself to attack. 
                    Dark Matter has taken on a friendlier form though, as Gooey is a strange form of it on Kirby's side. 
                    Speaking of, <a href="kirby.html">Kirby</a> himself is similar to Void.</p>
