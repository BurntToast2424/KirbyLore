                <h2>The Butterfly of Paradise</h2>
                <h3>Butterfly</h3>
                <p>The butterfly of paradise usually exists as a butterfly, searching for the recently deceased to judge their soul.
                    In this sense, the butterfly is death itself. However, it has a secondary purpose to end the lives of those long past their date.
                    This has only been seen to happen twice, once in a non-canon subgame. The butterfly lands on the being, and absorbs them entirely.
                    The first time this happened, it went into a new form.</p>
                <h3>Morpho Knight</h3>
                <p>In Star Allies, within the Guest Star subgame, Galacta Knight shows up as the final boss.
                    But before the fight even begins, the butterfly drifts on screen, apparently drawn to the 'screams of the many years spent living', 
                    and lands on the knight, absorbing them, and gaining their power.
                    Morpho Knight is born, and set's their focus on the player. In another subgame, the Ultimate Choice, an even more powerful form is fought.
                    Morpho Knight EX is what happens when Morpho Knight is given time to learn how to properly use their new power.<br><br>
                    In Forgotten Land, however, the butterfly shows up again, this time canonically, and absorbs Soul Forgo, once again becoming Morpho Knight.
                    Their body is unchanged, but their attack that summons multiple ghost-like heads is replaced with one, Soul Forgo shaped soul head.
                    After their defeat, Soul Forgo escapes, strengthened by the residual power of being one with the butterfly.</p>
                <h3>Beyond Timelines</h3>
                <p>The butterfly is the only being in Kirby lore that has the ability to cross between the timelines. 
                    While it is still a butterfly before absorbing Soul Forgo, it uses the form and powers it gained from absorbing Galacta Knight after.
                    As far as is known, however, Galacta Knight has yet to show up canonically, meaning that either the butterfly got to them offscreen, 
                    or it traveled from the Star Allies Guest Star subgame to the main timeline after being defeated.</p>
                <h3>Kirby's power</h3>
                <p>Kirby is the only character in the canon timeline that has shown the power to handle the power of Morpho Knight. 
                    Not only this, but many times in the Kirby series has a butterfly been seen resting on Kirby while Kirby was asleep.
                    These butterflies have the same orange and yellow design as the butterfly absorbing Galacta Knight and Soul Forgo.
                    The only difference being these butterflies do not absorb Kirby, and do not leave a trail of particles when they fly.
                    It is unknown if these butterflies are the same one, but if they are, it implies that it is trying and failing to absorb Kirby.</p>
