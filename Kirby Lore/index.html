                <h2>This Website</h2>
                <p>This website was created because Kirby lore is both interesting, and also confusing at times. 
                    While it does not cover all of Kirby lore, it does cover most of the more important parts. 
                    Kirby is an amazing series, and while it is possible to understand the lore of a game from just the game itself, 
                    there are some parts of the lore that are told throughout more than one game.
                    This website should put those pieces of the lore in one place.
                    All rights to the series of Kirby go to Nintendo and HAL Laboratory.</p>
