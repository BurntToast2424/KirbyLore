                <h2>Kirby himself</h2>
                <p>It is not known for how long Kirby has been around in Dream Land for. It is not even known how long Kirby has been alive for.
                    Kirby's species does not have an official name, but there are more than one of him. 
                    Shadow Kirby, from the mirror dimension, as well as Keeby, a yellow, second playable Kirby for Dream Course. 
                    Aside from these two, every confirmed member of the Kirby species is some kind of clone. 
                    Other characters, such as Meta Knight, and characters similar, look like Kirby under their mask, but it is unknown if they are the same species.<br><br>
                    As for what Kirby actually is, they are the opposite of Void and Dark Matter, being a powerful being of positive energy.
                    Void itself even makes a similar face to Kirby's for most of their fight. 
                    The fact that this is what Kirby is makes it unlikely that Meta Knight is the same species.</p>
